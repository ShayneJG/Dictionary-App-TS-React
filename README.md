This challenge was deisgned using React/Typescript/Tailwind. This was my first typescript project, and my first time using Vite. Typescript was an uphill battle when paired with React, but I eventually got my bearings :). 

A live version can be found at: https://shaynejg.github.io/Dictionary-App-TS-React/

Note: For display purposes only, the dictionary begins with the default word 'Origin'. 

Your users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.




<h1> Issues </h1>
<ul>
<li>No hover effect for the switch, as the package i used does not support it. </li>
 <li>Need to re-write synonym map to remove underline extending to the space before the word. Should use .join instead. </li>
 <li>Does not currently support using the browser back button. </li>
 </ul>
